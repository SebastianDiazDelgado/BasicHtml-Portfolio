<h2>TOP SERIES</h2>

<h3>1. Gravity falls:</h3>

<p>I used to watch it when i was kid, its amazing to see how they have to go through for differents situations but the most cool part was when Uncle Ford came back from the portal.
    And not just that because each episode has secret codes and messages to discover, so it was a pretty interactive story.</p>

<p>Also recently the creator released "the bill`s book" which explain how there are many universe in Gravity falls and what we watched was the only one they survived, is a great plot twist after many years of inactivity</p>

<h3>2. The Amazing World Of Gumball:</h3>

<p>This Animated Cartoon is the most fun, every one of his episodes have great quality and pretty funny jokes, always is cool watch Gumball`s and Darwin`s adventures they always get in troubles but never learn the lesson, but also watch some situations of another family member is enjoyable every one of they have a different kind of problem to face.</p>

<h3>3. Adventure Time</h3>

<p>Adventure time was another one of my chilhood series, at the start the show just showed some silly jokes and adventures with Finn and Jake but as he progress it turns in a deep story, having serious moments and every character have a backstory who is pretty interesting.</p>

<p>it has an amazing final but also is sad how they showed how hundreds of year has passed.</p>

<h3>4. Regular Show</h3>

<p>I also liked this one but not as much as the top ones. This Cartoon also went through something similar as adventure time it starts like a Cartoon with dumb and weird situations and Mordecai and Rigby have to resolve their own troubles but as they progress there`s a point in the Cartoon where the story change his course completly and goes through deeps situations.</p>

<h2>TOP MOVIES</h2>

<h3>1. Truman Show</h3>

<p> This is an amazing movie where the protagonist does`nt know he`s the Main character of the greatest Show of the World.</p>
<p>Basically the movie shows how Truman slowly realizes he is not in the real world  and all of his interactions are fake. </p>

<h3>2. Ready Player One</h3>

<p>Simply A lot of references to pop culture, a pretty good story and is amazing the gears they use to dive in another world, is like sword art online and amazing movie.</p>
